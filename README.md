    ## Does Marijuana legalization have a place in American society at large? This is a question that hasn’t strayed far from the spotlight for almost a decade now and has been the topic of many public and political discussions. Today, we have <insert figure> states that have legalized this drug and seen significant changes to their economies in different ways. With this project, we will take a look at how country-wide legalization of marijuana could affect the country at large. 

# Research Questions to Answer:
    ## Referencing both US states and countries that have already legalized marijuana, we will take a look at:
        * How the legalization of marijuana could affect the nation’s GDP and key economic industries, such as agriculture, finance, tourism and the healthcare industry at the macro level.
        * Beyond it’s direct correlation to finance, how population and human behavior will be affected.
        * What are the negative effects of legalization?
        * What changes occured from medicinal legalization to recreational legalization?
